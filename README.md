# The Board Spaces

## Unowned Property
There are three types of properties: Locations, Vehicles, and Power Sources. \
When you land on a Location, Vehicle, or Power Source you have two options: \
Option#1: \
-- Want to buy it? \
---- Pay the price shown on the board space and take the Title Deed Card \
Option#2: \
-- Don't want to buy it? \
---- The Banker must auction it. \
---- Bids start at $10. \
---- All players can bid. 

## Owned Locations
When you land on a location that someone else owns, pay them the rent shown \
on the location's Title Deed card. \
-- Color sets
---- Rent goes up on each Location as soon as you complete the set. \
---- In order to build hideouts and later upgrade to facility. \
---- Rent increases more when you build hideouts and facilities \
NOTE: The owner must ask you for rent before the next player rolls \
the dice. If they don't ask, you don't have to pay! 

## Owned Vehicles
When you land on a Vehicle that someone else owns, pay them rent. Rent depends on how many Vehicles the owner has as follows;
Vehicles 1 = $25
Vehicles 2 = $50
Vehicles 3 = $75
Vehicles 4 = $100
NOTE: The Millennium Falcon board space is a location, not a vehicle

## Owned Power Sources
When you land on a power source that soemone else owns, pay them rent.
Roll the dice again to decide rent. 
If the owner has 1 Power Source, rent is 4x the dice roll
If the owner has 2 Power Sources, rent is 10x the dice roll


# Action Spaces

## Go
If your move took you onto or past the GO space, collect $200 from the bank

## Suggler / Soundrel
Take the top card from the matching pile and immediately do what it says. 
Then return it to the bottom of the pile.

## Debt / Mercenary Fee
Pay the bank the amoutn shown on the space

## Free Parking
There'snothing to trade or smuggle here. Just wait until your next turn, then roll and move

## Just Visiting
Don't worry, you're not in Jail. Simply put you token in the Just Visiting Section

## Got to Jail
Move your token to the In Jail space immediately! Do not collect $200 for passing GO. Your turn is then over. You can still collect rent, auction, buy Hideouts and Facilities, mortgage, and trade while you are in jail.

# SO HOW DO I GET OUT OF JAIL? 
You have three options
1:	Pay $50: at the start of your next turn, then roll and move as normal
2:	Use a Get Out of Jail Free Card: atthe start of your net turn if you have one 
    (or buy one from another player). Put the card at the bottom of the appropriate pile, then roll and move.
3:	Roll a double: on your next turn. If you do, you're free! Use the roll to move, 	and that's the end of your turn. You can use up to 3 turns to try for a double. 	If you don't roll a double by your third turn in Jail, pay $50 and use your last
	roll to move.

# BUILDINGS
## Building Hideouts
1. As soon as you get a color set, you can start buying Hideouts (you don't have to
   wait for your turn).
2. Pay to the Bank the Hideout cost price on the Title Deed card and place a Hideout 	on the Location.
3. You must build evenly. You cannot build a second Hideout on a Location until		   you've built one on each Location in its color set. You can have only 4 Hideouts 
   on a location.

##  Building Facilities
Once you have 4 Hideouts on all Locations ina color set, you can pay to upgrade to a facility.
Pay to the bank the Facility cost price on the Title Deed Card, return all 4 Hideouts to the Bank, and put a Facility on the Location.
You can build only 1 Facility per Location.
You can't add any more Hideouts.
You cannot build on a Location if any location in its color set is mortgaged.

-- NOTE: Not enough buildings?
---- If multiple players want the last Hideout of Facility,
---- the Banker must auction it with the starting bid price of $10

-- NOTE: No buildings left?
---- You can't buy any until someone sells theirs back.


# AUCTIONS
If you land on an unowned Location, Vehicle, or Power Source and you don't want to buy it, the Banker must auction it.

1. The Banker starts the auction by offering the space to everyone for $10
2. Anyone can increase the bid by as little as $1 (even the Banker and the player
   who originally landed on the space).
3. The highest bidder wins the auction, pays the Bank, and takes the Title Deed card.

## What if no one wants it?
That's fine. No one pays anything

# Deals and Trades

1. You can buy, sells, or swap property with other players at any time.
2. You must sell all Hideouts and Facilities in a color set to the Bank before you
   can sell or trade a Location.
3. Property can be traded for cash, other property, and/or Get Out of Fail Free 
   cards. The amount is decided by the players making the deal.
4. Mortgaged property can be traded at any agreed price.
5. The new owner must immediately either:
-- repay the mortgage (pay the Bank the unmortgage cost), or
-- keep the mortgage (just pay the Bank 10% of the mortgage value now)


# HELP! I CAN'T PAY!
I. Try to raise money.
-- If you owe money and can't pay, try to raise money by selling buildings and/or mortgaging properties.

# Selling Buildings
Sell Facilities:
-- You can sell Facilities to the bank for half the cost price
-- The bank will then exchange your Facility for four Hideouts
Sell Hideouts
-- Sell Hideouts back to the Bank for half the cost price.
-- Hideouts must be sold evenly across the color set.

# Mortgage Property
To mortgage a property you must first sell to the Bank all buildings in its color set at half their cost price.
1. To mortgage a property:
-- Turn the Title Deed card facedown.
-- Collect the mortgage value shown on the back from the Bank.
2. To repay a mortgage:
-- Pay the unmortgage cost to the bank (mortgage value + 10%)
-- Turn the car faceup
NOTE: Rent cannot be collected on properties that are mortgaged. However, the increased rent level can be collected on the unmortgaged Locations in a color set.


## If you're still in debt, you are bankrupt and out of the game

Do you owe another player?
-- Give them any Get Out of Jail Free cards and all your mortgaged properties.
-- The new ownwer must immediately
---- replay the mortgage: pay the Bank the unmortgage cost, or
---- keep the mortgage: just pay the Bank 10% of the mortgage value now.
Do you owe the Bank?
-- Return all your properties to the bank.
-- Any mortgages are cancelled.
-- All your properties must immediately be put up for auction.
-- Return any Get out of Jail Free Cards to the bottom of the pile. 

The remaining players keep playing until there is only one person left in the game.
That player is the victor!

# TOP TIPS
Lending money between players, receiving cash for landing on Free Parking, and never auctioning properties are just some of the "house" rules that lengthen the game.
To keep your game short and sweet, don't use house rules!
Always auction when someone doesn't want to buy the property they've landed on.
Never loan money to other players or make deals not to charge each other rent
Never put cash in the center of the board; you don't get a bonus for landing on Free Parking!
